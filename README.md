## news-aggregator

This was the first major project I made while in the coding bootcamp. I became sick of flicking from website to website during my morning commute to catch up on tech news, so this aggregates news from the few websites that I was interested and puts them all in a feed. It's intentionally boring-looking so I'm not distracted(?) by pictures.
I update it occasionally to add new sources depending on what interests me at the time.
